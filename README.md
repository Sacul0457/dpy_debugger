# About
This repository searches a file and warns users about potential dangers/bad practices in their discord.py code. This is mainly for beginners and therefore to run this, is super simple.

# Cloning it (i.e how you would obtain this code)
Open your terminal and run, this clones this repository into your directory.
```py
git clone https://github.com/Sacul0457/dpy_debugger.git
```

# Using it
For instance, run this in your terminal where `main.py` is the file you want to check. 
```py
python -m dpy_debugger main.py
```
It can also check multiple files like so
```py
python -m dpy_debugger main.py bot.py
```

# About the Code
I know it's super messy, especially the parser. This whole debugger thingy I made in less that a day, but I'll continue to improve overtime!
Also I call it a debugger since I don't really know what else to call it, if it's not one, please let me know!

# Contributing
If you know d.py or python very well, your contribution is more than appreciated!
